abstract: "Planted even-aged forests dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies) progressively replaced mixed natural forests in large parts of Central Europe during past centuries due to the productivity-motivated preferences of forest owners. These managed forests have become vulnerable to climate change, specifically to increasingly severe drought. To evaluate the response of trees to warming, we built a unique set of tree-ring width series covering the entire forested part of the Czech Republic. We collected samples from a randomized landscape inventory grid of 7x7 km to account for spatial gradients in growth/climate interactions. The Vaganov-Shashkin "Lite" forward model was used to identify a course of climatic limiting factors on an intra-annual scale. Relative proportions of moisture and temperature limited parts of total tree-ring width were determined as well as trends in limiting conditions over the period 1940-2012 and along the elevation gradient. Significant match between modelled and observed growth was shown in 47 % of the grid cells. The coherence between modelled and observed site series was significantly improved when individual grid cells were aggregated into elevation belts. In grid cells below 600 m, from 51 to 58 % of tree-ring width was formed under moisture-limited conditions, with the proportion of growth under optimal conditions minimal. Positive trends in total tree-ring width consistent with warming were observed for areas situated above 500 m. Up to 25 % of tree-ring growth occurred in optimal climatic conditions in elevations above 800 m, where, moreover, 45 % of total annual growth took place in limiting temperatures. Except for one medium-elevation belt, the proportion of growth under moisture-limited conditions significantly increased during the period analysed. Recent warming and increasing frequency of drought events deepened the divergence in growth trends between low-elevation areas and stands at medium and high elevations."
